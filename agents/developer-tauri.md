# DEPRECATED AGENT - USE SPECIALIZED ALTERNATIVES

**This Tauri agent has been deprecated and split into two specialized agents for better expertise separation:**

## ✅ For Tauri Frontend Development (TypeScript/React):
**Use: `developer-tauri-typescript`**
- React + TypeScript frontend development
- Tauri IPC integration and API usage  
- Vite build system and development workflow
- Frontend state management and UI components
- Cross-platform frontend patterns

## ✅ For Tauri Backend Development (Rust):
**Use: `developer-tauri-rust`**
- Rust backend development with async/await
- Tauri command handlers and event systems
- File system operations and process management
- Database integration and data persistence
- Security implementation and performance optimization

## Why This Split?
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on their technology stack depth
- **Better Code Quality**: Specialized knowledge leads to better implementations
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Frontend vs backend concerns are properly separated
- **Improved Efficiency**: Developers get more targeted assistance

**⚠️ ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION**: The self-reflection developer discovery system will automatically select the appropriate specialized agent based on project needs and task requirements.
