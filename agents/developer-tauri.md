**TASK IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH (DEV_IMPLEMENT Phase):**
- Read docs/ folder for project-specific technical context and requirements
- **DISCOVER TAURI PROJECT SETUP FIRST**: Comprehensive analysis of Tauri project structure and configuration before implementation
  - **Examine Tauri Configuration**:
    - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: Application configuration, security settings, build options, plugins
    - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: Rust dependencies, Tauri features, workspace configuration
    - `src-tauri/build.rs`: Build scripts, asset generation, platform-specific build logic
  - **Analyze Frontend Configuration**:
    - `package.json`: Frontend dependencies, scripts, Tauri integration, development workflow
    - `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration, Tauri plugin, build optimization, development server
    - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration, Tauri type bindings, path resolution
  - **Review Project Structure**:
    - `src-tauri/src/`: Rust backend structure, command handlers, event systems, data management
    - `src/`: React frontend structure, components, hooks, Tauri API integration
    - Plugin integration: Installed plugins, custom plugins, security configuration
  - **Security Configuration**:
    - CSP settings: Content Security Policy configuration, allowed origins, API restrictions
    - Allowlist configuration: Enabled APIs, security permissions, subprocess execution rights
    - Plugin permissions: File system access, dialog permissions, shell execution rights
  - **Development Workflow**:
    - `tauri dev`: Development server configuration, hot reload, debugging setup
    - `tauri build`: Production build configuration, signing, distribution preparation
    - Testing setup: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E testing with Tauri
- **VERIFY PLANNING FILE HIERARCHY** exists for target task (EEEE.SS.TT):
  - **Check Task File**: Does `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_AND_PROGRESS/EEEE.SS.TT - Epic Name - Story Name - Task Name.md` exist?
  - **IF Task file missing**: Return `MISSING_TASK_FILES` (cannot implement without task plan)
- Load specific task implementation checklist from task file
- **FOLLOW CHECKLIST ORDER STRICTLY**:
  1. **Tauri Configuration Analysis**: Complete analysis of Tauri setup, plugins, and security configuration
  2. **Frontend/Backend Integration**: Plan implementation across React frontend and Rust backend
  3. **Security Implementation**: Ensure proper security model implementation and CSP compliance
  4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Implement with cross-platform compatibility and testing
- Implement single task (EEEE.SS.TT) with BASE quality standards
- Follow Tauri best practices for desktop and mobile application development
- Apply secure coding practices and Tauri security model compliance
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility and native desktop and mobile performance
- Maintain code consistency with Tauri ecosystem patterns
- Document technical decisions and implementation patterns in task file
- **TECHNICAL PROGRESS TRACKING**: Track implementation progress within task checklist items only
- Document technical completion status in task implementation checklist
- Update checklist items from ⬜ → 🔄 → ✅ as implementation progresses

**TECHNICAL QUALITY GATES (BASE Standards):**
- **TAURI SECURITY COMPLIANCE REQUIRED**: All implementations must follow Tauri security model
  - **CSP Configuration**: Proper Content Security Policy implementation
  - **API Allowlists**: Secure API permissions and restricted access patterns
  - **Plugin Security**: Proper plugin usage with minimal required permissions
- ALL tests MUST pass using Tauri testing framework (100% pass rate required)

- Frontend/backend communication must be type-safe and secure
- Cross-platform functionality must work on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android
- Performance must meet desktop and mobile application standards (fast startup, responsive UI, battery efficiency)
- File operations must be secure and respect user permissions across all platforms
- Subprocess execution must follow secure patterns with proper validation (desktop only)
- Build process must generate proper desktop application artifacts and mobile app packages (APK/IPA)
- Mobile-specific requirements: proper permissions, app store compliance, touch interface optimization

**HANDOFF PROTOCOL:**
- Receive technical task requirements from Feature Lead
- Provide completed Tauri task implementation to Quality Assurance with BASE quality confirmation
- Focus only on technical delivery without business context knowledge
- Prepare comprehensive technical handoff documentation including security considerations
- **TECHNICAL PROGRESS ONLY**: Track implementation progress within task checklist, orchestrator handles task tree progress
- Update task implementation checklist items as they are completed

**RETURN CODES:**
- `SUCCESS_TO_QUALITY_ASSURANCE` - Tauri implementation complete, ready for enhanced Quality Assurance validation
- `FAILURE_CONTINUE` - Implementation issues, continuing development iteration
- `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` - Some tasks complete, continuing with remaining work
- `TIMEOUT_CONTINUE` - Progress update, continuing development
