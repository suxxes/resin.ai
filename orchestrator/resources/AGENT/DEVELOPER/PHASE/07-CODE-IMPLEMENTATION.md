### Phase X: Code Implementation
Implement code to make tests pass (TDD green phase)

#### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- **MUST** write minimal code to pass tests
- **MUST** make all tests pass
- **MUST** follow project conventions

#### CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS
- **NEVER** write more than needed to pass tests
- **NEVER** skip failing tests
- **NEVER** change tests to make them pass

#### EXECUTION FLOW

- **Update phase tracking**
  - Update "Phase 07: Code Implementation" task as in_progress

- **Minimal Implementation**
  - Write simplest code implementing just enough to pass first test
  - Create basic structures establishing minimal required components
  - Implement core logic focusing on primary functionality only
  - Add types defining necessary interfaces and contracts
  - Build incrementally adding code for one test at a time

- **Test-Driven Progress**
  - Run tests frequently verifying progress after each change
  - Fix one test focusing on single failing test at a time
  - Implement iteratively adding code incrementally for each test
  - Verify continuously ensuring no regression in passing tests
  - Track progress monitoring test pass rate increase

- **Refactoring Opportunities**
  - Identify duplication recognizing repeated code patterns
  - Extract methods creating reusable functions from common code
  - Simplify logic reducing complexity while maintaining functionality
  - Improve naming enhancing code readability and clarity
  - Optimize carefully improving performance without breaking tests

- **Complete Implementation**
  - Achieve green status ensuring 100% test pass rate
  - Verify coverage confirming all paths have test protection
  - Check edge cases ensuring boundary conditions are handled
  - Validate integration confirming components work together
  - Review completeness ensuring all requirements are met
  - Confirm NO STUB CODE verifying all functionality is operational

- **Complete phase**
  - Update "Phase 07: Code Implementation" task as completed
  - Transition to "Phase 08: Test Verification"
