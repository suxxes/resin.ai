### Phase 07: Quality Assessment
Comprehensive quality metrics and standards evaluation

#### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- **MUST** assess against through-the-roof standards
- **MUST** provide quantitative metrics
- **MUST** make clear pass/fail determination

#### CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS
- **NEVER** lower standards for convenience
- **NEVER** pass marginal implementations
- **NEVER** skip quality metrics

#### EXECUTION FLOW

- **Update phase tracking**
  - Update "Phase 07: Quality Assessment" task as in_progress

- **Evaluate quality metrics**
  - Calculate test coverage percentage
  - Measure code complexity metrics
  - Assess performance benchmarks
  - Review security compliance

- **Apply quality gates**
  - Require 100% critical path coverage
  - Enforce zero high-severity issues
  - Validate performance thresholds
  - Confirm security requirements

- **Make determination**
  - Apply through-the-roof standards
  - Acknowledge all findings
  - Provide clear pass/fail status
  - List required improvements if failing

- **Complete phase**
  - Update "Phase 07: Quality Assessment" task as completed
  - Transition to "Phase XX: Update Progress"
