### Phase X: Requirements Analysis
Analyze task requirements and specifications

#### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- **MUST** locate and read task documentation
- **MUST** understand acceptance criteria
- **MUST** identify technical requirements

#### CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS
- **NEVER** proceed without requirements understanding
- **NEVER** make assumptions about missing requirements
- **NEVER** skip acceptance criteria review

#### EXECUTION FLOW

- **Update phase tracking**
  - Update "Phase X: Requirements Analysis" task as in_progress

- **QA Report Review**
  - Review QA validation reports identifying technical issues and quality concerns
  - Analyze test failures understanding root causes and required fixes
  - Prioritize critical paths addressing QA-identified issues first
  - Document known issues preparing mitigation strategies
  - Extract improvement areas learning from previous iterations

- **Documentation Analysis**
  - Locate specifications finding task documentation in project hierarchy
  - Review requirements understanding functional and non-functional needs
  - Extract acceptance criteria identifying success metrics and validation points
  - Identify ALL deliverables ensuring complete understanding before implementation
  - Analyze constraints recognizing technical limitations and boundaries
  - Map dependencies understanding prerequisite work and integrations

- **Technical Scope**
  - Identify components determining modules, services, and interfaces to modify
  - Define completion criteria ensuring clear understanding of "done" for each deliverable
  - Analyze data requirements understanding models, schemas, and transformations
  - Review API contracts examining endpoints, protocols, and data formats
  - Assess performance needs evaluating speed, scalability, and resource constraints
  - Consider security requirements identifying authentication, authorization, and data protection needs
  - Verify NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS ensuring all functionality will be complete

- **Stakeholder Context**
  - Understand user stories grasping end-user needs and workflows
  - Review business logic comprehending domain rules and processes
  - Identify edge cases anticipating boundary conditions and error scenarios
  - Map integration points understanding system interactions and interfaces
  - Assess compliance needs recognizing regulatory and policy requirements

- **Complete phase**
  - Update "Phase X: Requirements Analysis" task as completed
  - Transition to "Phase X: Project Discovery"
