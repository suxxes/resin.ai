## TASK IMPLEMENTATION

### **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**
- Review QA validation reports for technical issues, quality concerns, and test failures
- Identify ALL required deliverables before beginning any implementation
- Ensure complete understanding of functional requirements and success criteria

### Preliminary Analysis
- **Review QA reports** to understand technical issues that must be prioritized
- **Analyze requirements** including functional, technical, and user experience aspects
- **Identify all deliverables** understanding every component, feature, and capability
- **Design complete approach** that delivers ALL functionality, not stubs or partial implementations
- **Define completion criteria** ensuring clear understanding of "done" for each deliverable
- **Read project documentation** for specific technical context and requirements

### Implementation Strategy
- **Start with critical paths** addressing QA-identified issues first
- **Build incrementally** with working functionality at each step
- **Test continuously** validating each component as it's built
- **Maintain consistency** with existing project patterns and conventions
- **Document progress** updating task status at each milestone
