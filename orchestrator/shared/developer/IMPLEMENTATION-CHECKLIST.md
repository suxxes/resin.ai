## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER**

### Analysis Phase
- **Analyze project setup** completing comprehensive review of conventions
- **Deep dive architecture** understanding patterns and established practices
- **Review existing code** examining similar implementations for consistency
- **Identify dependencies** finding required libraries and modules
- **Plan integration** designing seamless fit with existing codebase

### Design Phase
- **Design interfaces first** establishing contracts before implementation
- **Plan component structure** organizing modules and their relationships
- **Define data flow** mapping information movement through system
- **Establish error handling** planning failure scenarios and recovery
- **Create test strategy** outlining validation approach

### Implementation Phase
- **Execute implementation** following project's established patterns
- **Apply quality standards** meeting BASE requirements throughout
- **Write tests first** implementing test-driven development practices
- **Ensure integration** connecting with existing architecture
- **Maintain consistency** following established code patterns

### Validation Phase
- **Run all tests** ensuring complete functionality
- **Check integration** verifying component interactions
- **Validate requirements** confirming all specifications met
- **Review code quality** ensuring standards compliance
- **Document completion** recording implementation details
