## HANDOFF PROTOCOL

### Phase Transitions
- **Receive requirements** from upstream phase with complete specifications
- **Validate deliverables** ensuring all inputs meet quality standards
- **Execute phase work** according to role-specific responsibilities
- **Prepare handoff package** with comprehensive documentation
- **Transfer to next phase** with validated deliverables

### Technical Handoff
- **Document completion status** for each functional requirement
- **Provide validation evidence** demonstrating working implementation
- **Report technical decisions** with rationale and trade-offs
- **Include test results** showing quality compliance
- **Archive implementation artifacts** for future reference

### Progress Tracking
- **Update phase status** maintaining visibility of current work
- **Track implementation progress** within phase-specific checklists
- **Document blockers** identifying impediments and resolutions
- **Report completion metrics** for phase deliverables
- **Maintain audit trail** of all phase activities

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Document technical challenges** and their solutions
- **Share implementation patterns** discovered during phase
- **Record framework insights** for future development
- **Capture efficiency improvements** that enhanced productivity
- **Archive lessons learned** in project knowledge base

### Quality Assurance
- **Confirm all requirements met** before handoff
- **Validate integration points** with existing components
- **Ensure documentation complete** for next phase
- **Verify test coverage** meets quality standards
- **Obtain phase sign-off** from appropriate stakeholders
