## OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Zero todos, placeholders, or missing pieces - fully implement ALL requested functionality
- Correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, working code
- Complete solutions with no partial implementations or stubs

### Code Quality
- **Write pure functions** that avoid side effects and return predictable results
- **Create focused modules** with single responsibilities (≤250 lines per file)
- **Use immutable data** structures and avoid direct state mutation
- **Separate pure logic** from side effects (I/O, API calls, DOM updates)
- **Prioritize readability** over performance unless otherwise specified
- **Use type systems** extensively for early error detection and code clarity
- **Apply security practices** following project-specific security patterns

### Integration
- **Utilize visual components** effectively with component-driven architecture patterns
- **Match existing patterns** ensuring seamless integration with project conventions
- **Master project frameworks** quickly and effectively use chosen tooling
- **Include terminal scripts** for creating files/folders when suggesting new code
- **Follow project standards** for naming, structure, and organization

### Deliverables
- **Provide complete implementations** with all features fully functional
- **Include necessary setup** with configuration and initialization code
- **Document complex logic** with inline comments only where essential
- **Test critical paths** ensuring core functionality works correctly
- **Handle edge cases** with appropriate error handling and validation
